Eventually we would create a copy and paste function to download videos from Instagram

WHAT ARE WE IN QUEST FOR?
Change the logo to Block like this(rapid LINKER) with different colors
Arrange the schemas of the history properly cox it is only the original url thats visible.

URL -- SHorten url

I guess we need to correct the url given to mean the shortened url to another name and converge it inside the models
In order to accomplish this we use the same pattern as for that of the "original url" regarded as the "targeted url"

According to what we can see the original url is generaded from the crud.py in which "target_url" was also created this relates to the "create url" in the url.py file in which the whole generation was made

I think by this the error occur by the tie we created the function on the crud by excluding a model that is responsible for shorter url which would be linked to the model

Ask AI why is it necessary to use secrete key while deleting on the shortner url website
